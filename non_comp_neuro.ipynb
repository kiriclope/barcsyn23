        "Quantum gates form the primitive operations on quantum data. Quantum gates represent information preserving, reversible transformations on the quantum data stored in qubits. These “unitary” transformations represent the quantum mechanical core of a quantum circuit. Some gates such as (also written as) and  have classical analogs such as bit-flip and operations, respectively, while others do not. The Hadamard () gate, along with the parameterized rotates and generate superposition states, while gates such as and impart phases that can be used for interference. Two-qubit gates like the  gate are used to generate entanglement between pairs of qubits, or to “kick” the phase from one qubit to another. In contrast to gates, operations like “measurement”, represented by the meter symbol in a box with a line connecting to a “target” wire, extract partial information about a qubit’s state, often losing the phase, to be able to represent it as a classical bit and write that classical bit onto the target wire (often a fully classical wire in some readout device). This is the typical way to take information from the quantum data into a classical device. Note that with only, and measurement gates, i.e. a universal gate set, we can construct any quantum circuit, including those efficiently computing the dynamics of any physical system in nature.\n",

        "As with the noise cancellation example above, the amplitude and phase of qubits are continuous degrees of freedom upon which operations can never be done exactly. These gates errors, along with noise from the environment in which a quantum computer resides, can conspire to ruin a computation if not accounted for in the compilation process, and may require additional mitigation procedures in order to obtain a high-fidelity output on present day quantum systems susceptible to noise. Qiskit is capable of taking into account a wide range of device calibration metrics (see figure below) in its compilation strategy, and can select an optimal set of qubits on which to run a given quantum circuit. In addition, Qiskit hosts a collection of noise mitigation techniques for extracting a faithful representation of a quantum circuits output.\n",

The outputs from our neural network's previous layer will be collected and used as the inputs for our parameterized circuit. The measurement statistics of our quantum circuit can then be collected and used as inputs for the following layer. A simple example is depicted below:\n",
